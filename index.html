		<h3>Time line of P.Keres life</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Born January 7, 1916</li>
			<li>Keres was a three-time Estonian schoolboy champion, in 1930, 1932, and 1933.</li>
			<li>Keres achieved a very good result at the age of 17 in a Master tournament at Tallinn 1933 with 5/7 (+5−2=0), tied 3rd–4th, half a point behind joint winners Paul Felix Schmidt and V. Kappe</li>
			<li>Keres played on top board for Estonia in the 6th Chess Olympiad at Warsaw 1935, and was regarded as the new star, admired for his dashing style. His success there gave him the confidence to venture onto the international circuit.</li>
			<li>In 1938 he tied with Fine for first, with 8½/14, in the all-star AVRO tournament, held in various cities in the Netherlands, ahead of chess legends Mikhail Botvinnik, Max Euwe, Reshevsky, Alekhine, Capablanca and Flohr.</li>
			<li>Although he participated in the 1948 World Championship tournament, arranged to determine the world champion after Alekhine's death in 1946, his performance was far from his best.</li>
			<li>He won the exceptionally strong USSR Chess Championship three times</li>
			<li>After being forced to become a Soviet citizen, Keres represented the Soviet Union in seven consecutive Olympiads, winning seven consecutive team gold medals, five board gold medals, and one bronze board medal.</li>
			<li>Keres' last major tournament win was Tallinn 1975, ahead of Spassky and Friðrik Ólafsson, just a few months before his death</li>
			<li>FIDE has named 2016 the year of Paul Keres.</li>
